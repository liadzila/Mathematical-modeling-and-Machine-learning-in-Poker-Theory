# Mathematical Modeling and Machine Learning in Poker Theory.

In this work the efficiency of standard shuffling procedures used in Texas Hold’em for deck randomization were examined. Classical shuffle models, as well as two proposed models were used in the analysis. Randomness of the deck was evaluated using Total Variation distance metric and Pearson’s Chi-square test.
